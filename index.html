              <h3>Webassign, Course Text and other Resources</h3>


              <p>
                <em>Assigned Exercises</em> will be distributed, and your responses submitted, on the
                <a href="http://www.webassign.net" target="_blank"><strong>Webassign</strong></a> Web site.
                Therefore, you must enroll in the Course on the Webassign site and obtain Webassign access
                to the Course Text. To enroll on Webassign, you must use the <em>class key</em>:
                <strong>montclair 6107 1549</strong>.
              </p>
            <p> 
                If you do not already have an account on Webassign, you must create one. On Webassign,
                your user name should be your Montclair State NetID and your e-mail address should be your
                Montclair State e-mail address.
              </p>
              <p>
                To access the assignments on Webassign after the initial 13-day grace
                period, you must either enter a personal access code
                (included with a new textbook) or purchase access directly on the Webassign Web site.
              </p>
              <p>
                The <em>course text</em> is <strong><em>Calculus: Early Transcendentals</em></strong>
                (8th Edition) by J. Stewart.
                This same book was the course text for Calculus II (MATH221) at Montclair State University
                last semester (Spring, 2016). There are a number of paper and electronic variants of this text,
                each with its own ISBN. If you purchased a used copy of the text, it probably did <em>not</em>
                include an access code for Webassign. If you obtained a Webassign access code to this text
                for a previous course (Calculus I and/or Calculus II), the same code can be used
                for this course. Before making a purchase, I strongly encourage you to compare prices for the
                text, including the cost of Webassign access.
              </p>
              <p>
                At times, we will make use of <strong>plotting software</strong>.
                I will assume that you have access to a hand-held graphing
                calculator or similarly capable device, for both in-class activities and
                exams. Calculator and graphing applications are available for
                devices such as smart phones and tablets. While I have not used such "apps" myself,
                I encourage you to try them and let me know how well they serve the demands of the course.
              </p>
              <p>
                In accordance with Department Policy, during in-class exams you may only use calcualtors
                that do <em>not</em> have computer-algebra capability. 
              </p>
              
            <h3>Class</h3>

              <p>
                Class attendance is an integral part of the course. In my experience,
                students who do not attend class regularly have difficulty on exams.
                While attendance and participation in class are not, in
                themselves, sufficient to learn the material, they play an important
                role in the learning process. 
              </p> 
              <p>
                The class periods are times for focus on the course material. Therefore,
                in class, you should refrain from making/accepting calls and text
                messages, as well as unrelated use of computers/hand-held devices.
                Such activities also distract others who are focused on the class.
              </p>
              <p>
                You are responsible for all in-class announcements of assignments,
                schedule changes and other Course adjustments. Moreover, you should
                check your Montclair State e-mail regularly for updates and announcements.
              </p>


            <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>

            <p>
              I presume and expect that each student will maintain a high level of
              academic honesty and integrity in this course (and throughout his
              or her academic career).
            </p>
            <p> 
              For all in-class exams, you will be informed of the authorized
              references and resources. Moreover, unless otherwise directed,
              you may not receive assistance from, or collaborate with, others
              in completing an exam. The use of unauthorized resources or
              unauthorized collaboration constitutes a serious breach
              of academic honesty.
              Sanctions for academic dishonesty include a failing grade for the
              course and notification of the Dean of the College.  
            </p>  
            <p>
              Collaboration with others in completion of the assigned exercises, and
              in preparation for exams, is highly encouraged and does not constitute
              academic dishonesty. Nevertheless, all work submitted in completion of
              assigned exercises should reflect your own understanding of the relevant
              material.
